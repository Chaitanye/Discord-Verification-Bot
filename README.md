#### Rate Limiting & Usage Tracking
- **Daily Limits**: Conservative 1,000 API calls per day with automatic reset
- **Usage Monitoring**: Real-time tracking with logging
- **Graceful Degradation**: Automatic fallback when limits reached

### Expected Usage Statistics

**Before Optimization:**
- Profile Analysis: ~100% AI calls for all new users
- Response Verification: ~100% AI calls for all verifications
- Daily API Usage: ~200-300 calls for 50 users

**After Optimization:**
- Profile Analysis: ~30% AI calls (only borderline cases)
- Response Verification: ~40% AI calls (only complex responses)
- Daily API Usage: ~80-120 calls for 50 users (**60% reduction**)

## üéØ Suspicion Score System

The bot calculates a suspicion score (0-4) for every new user based on profile analysis:

### Score Breakdown

#### Score: 0/4 - üü¢ TRUSTED
- Account age > 1 year
- Custom profile picture
- Normal username without numbers
- **Questions Given:** Standard difficulty

#### Score: 1/4 - üü° LOW SUSPICION  
- Account age 1-12 months
- Has custom avatar OR normal username
- **Questions Given:** Standard difficulty

#### Score: 2/4 - üü† MODERATE SUSPICION
- Account age 1-4 weeks
- No custom avatar OR some numbers in username
- **Questions Given:** Standard difficulty  

#### Score: 3/4 - üî¥ HIGH SUSPICION
- Account age < 1 week
- No custom avatar AND suspicious username
- **Questions Given:** Medium difficulty

#### Score: 4/4 - üö® VERY HIGH SUSPICION
- Brand new account (< 1 day)
- High-risk keywords in username
- **Questions Given:** High difficulty

### Suspicion Factors Analyzed

**Account Age Weight:**
- < 1 day: +3 points (very suspicious)
- < 7 days: +2 points (suspicious)  
- < 30 days: +1 point (somewhat new)
- > 365 days: -1 point (established, reduces suspicion)

**Avatar Analysis:**
- No custom avatar: +1 point
- Custom Discord avatar: -1 point (good sign)

**Username Patterns:**
- **Very Suspicious (+2 points)**: 6+ consecutive numbers, high-risk keywords (discord, nitro, gift, free, hack, bot, raid)
- **Moderately Suspicious (+1 point)**: 4-5 consecutive numbers, medium risk keywords (test, fake, temp, alt)
- **Positive Indicators (-1 point)**: Long username without numbers (8+ chars), Discord Nitro subscriber

## üîÑ Question Management

### Question Structure

Your `questions.json` follows this structure:

```json
{
  "entry": [
    {"id": "E1", "question": "What brings you to this community?"}
  ],
  "reflective": [
    {"id": "R1", "question": "What do you feel about spiritual life?"}
  ],
  "psychological": {
    "trusted": [{"id": "P1", "question": "Low suspicion question"}],
    "medium": [{"id": "P3", "question": "Medium suspicion question"}],
    "high": [{"id": "P5", "question": "High suspicion question"}]
  }
}
```

### Auto-Sync Features

- **File Modification Detection**: Bot automatically detects when `questions.json` is modified
- **Command-Based Sync**: `/reload_questions` reloads questions AND syncs AI config
- **Startup Sync Check**: Bot loads questions and AI config together at startup

### Best Practices

1. **Always use `/reload_questions`** after editing questions
2. **Test new questions** with a test account first
3. **Backup your questions.json** before major changes
4. **Monitor Discord sync confirmations** after changes

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Cloudflare Rate Limiting (Render Deployment)

If you see "Error 1015" or "Rate limited by Cloudflare" in the logs:

**This is normal and expected** - The bot has built-in protection:
- **Automatic retry**: Bot retries with exponential backoff (20s, 60s, 120s, 300s...)
- **Enhanced headers**: Browser-like requests to reduce detection
- **Render restart**: Service automatically restarts after max retries
- **Eventually succeeds**: Cloudflare blocking is temporary

**What to do:**
1. **Wait** - Let the bot retry automatically
2. **Check logs** - Look for "‚úÖ Bot connected successfully!"
3. **Be patient** - May take 5-20 minutes in worst cases
4. **Don't restart manually** - Built-in retry logic is optimized

### Common Issues

#### Bot Not Connecting
- Check `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` environment variable
- Verify bot permissions in Discord server
- Check Render logs for connection errors

#### Service Sleeping
- Web server keeps service alive automatically
- Check `/health` endpoint is responding
- Monitor Render dashboard for activity

#### AI Not Working
- Verify `AI_API_KEY` is set correctly
- Check Google Gemini API service status
- Bot will use fallback scoring if AI fails

#### Questions Not Loading
1. Check `questions.json` syntax with JSON validator
2. Ensure file is saved in correct format (UTF-8)
3. Run `/reload_questions` to see error details

### Advanced Cloudflare Startup

For regions with severe Cloudflare rate limiting, use the enhanced startup script:

**Enhanced Start Command for Render:**
```bash
python3 cloudflare_startup.py
```

**Optional Environment Variable:**
```env
STARTUP_DELAY=15  # Additional startup delay in seconds
```

This provides extra protection with random startup delays and enhanced retry logic.

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check service status
curl https://your-app.onrender.com/health

# View bot details
curl https://your-app.onrender.com/status

# Simple connectivity test
curl https://your-app.onrender.com/ping
```

### Log Messages to Watch For

- `‚úÖ Bot connected successfully!` - Connection established
- `üîÑ Bot connection attempt X/5` - Retry in progress
- `‚è≥ Waiting Xs before connection attempt` - Rate limit protection active
